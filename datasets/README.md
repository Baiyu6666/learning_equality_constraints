# Datasets Overview

This folder contains dataset generators and dataset-related assets used by the project.

Main entry:
- `datasets/constraint_datasets.py`
- function: `generate_dataset(name, cfg)`

## Naming Notes

- Repository dataset names such as `3d_torus_surface_traj` are internal ids used by configs and code.
- The paper uses cleaner environment names such as `3DTorus`.
- When both a base version and a `_traj` version exist, the `_traj` version is the default environment variant used in the paper experiments.
- Non-`_traj` versions use scatter samples of true constraint; `_traj` versions use trajectory demonstrations on the same underlying constraint.
- If a dataset does not appear in the paper, the paper-name column is left blank.

## Derived Naming Rules

- `3d_vz_<base_2d_dataset>`: lift a 2D base dataset to 3D with varying `z(x,y)` (`data_dim=3`, `codim=2`)
- `3d_0z_<base_2d_dataset>`: lift a 2D base dataset to 3D with `z=0` (`data_dim=3`, `codim=2`)
- `_traj` suffix: trajectory-style sampling variant of the same underlying constraint

## Return Format

- `x_train`: training points on manifold
- `grid`: dense manifold samples used as reference/evaluation set
